## SummerPlacement
# Particle Physics Placement Vector Boson Fusion
- Aim of the placement was to isolate electroweak vector boson fusion (EW Zll) processes out of the many processes occurring in LHC Monte Carlo simulation data.
- This process could produce a theoretical Z' boson.
- It was found that the EW Zll process made up 4.36% of the search (EW enriched) region data and 1.66% of the control (strong interaction, QCD, enriched) region.
